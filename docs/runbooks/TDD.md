## Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is the process of writing a failing tests based on a user story or expectation, writing the simplest code to pass the test and then refactoring. This red-green-refactor cycle is repeated until all the requirements have been met.

By following this pattern, a focused design emerges where you write only the code you need that is fully covered by tests. It also ensures that the structure of your code follows many of the SOLID principals due to the necessity of ensuring your code is testable.

As an experiment, all code written in Serve-OPG should be done so following TDD. Once the project has been completed we can gain some real life insight into how it impacts a projects delivery, quality and reliability.
