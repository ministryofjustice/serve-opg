## API Container (L&D)

For Learning and development purposes, there was work done to split out the API layer
of the application into a separate container written in golang.

Whilst we may reintroduce this work at some point in the future, for now, it has been removed
in this commit hash: 8f11031082f06ca1b24be12a4a66757db8deaad4

We did this to make the app easier to maintain and less confusing as the work never made it to live.

This can be reverted if we ever decide to pick up this work again.
